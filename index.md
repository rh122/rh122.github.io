# Graph Transformation for Software Engineers
## With Applications to Model-Based Development and Domain-Specific Language Engineering

*Reiko Heckel, University of Leicester, UK*

*Gabriele Taentzer, Philipps-Universität Marburg, Germany*

On these pages we provide a number of resources for the book, including general information, expert opinions, a table of contents and downloadable authors copy, exercises, lecture slides and a discussion forum for comments and questions.

## Overview

The first part of the book presents the fundamentals in a precise, yet largely informal way. Besides serving as prerequisite for describing the applications in the second part, it also provides a comprehensive and systematic survey of the concepts, notations and techniques of graph transformation. The second part presents and discusses a range of applications to both model-based software engineering and domain-specific language engineering. The variety of these applications demonstrates how broadly graphs and graph transformations can be used to model, analyse and implement complex software systems and languages.

This is the first textbook that explains the most commonly used concepts, notations, techniques and applications of graph transformation without focusing on one particular mathematical representation or implementation approach. Emphasising the research and engineering methodologies used, it will be a valuable re-source for graduate students, practitioners and researchers in software engineering, foundations of programming and formal methods.


## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/rh122/rh122.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown
